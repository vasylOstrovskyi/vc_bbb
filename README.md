How to use it.

On the event setup page, select Services->Videoconference.
Here you can create and configure rooms for event, pre-upload presentations, set moderators etc.

If the moderator visits the event page, they can start meeting anytime before the scheduled end of the meeting. If the meeting was terminated due to any reason, it can be restarted ans many times as necessary.

If any other user visits the event page, and if the meeting is running, they can join it (if the user is not logeed in, they will be asked to login first to identify themselves)

After meeting end, recordings (if the moderator choose to record session) are available as soon as they are processed by the BigBlueButton server (it may take from several minutes to several hours)
Recordings which are not needed, can be removed on the event setup page.
